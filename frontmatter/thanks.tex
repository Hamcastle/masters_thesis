% the acknowledgments section

I first wish to thank my supervisor, Peter Bex, for his kind support and guidance in the development of these experiments. My thanks also to Rhea Eskew for graciously agreeing to serve as the other member of my review committee. I'd also like to thank the members of the Bex Lab, past and present, for their feedback and willingness to act as subjects during the piloting phase of this project. Finally I'd like to thank Sarah Sohm, without whose patience and kind understanding it could not have been completed.
